I use this organization to store the projects I've created or been a part of
over the years. It's possible that major projects aren't included in this
organization for various reasons, such as not being the sole owner, being
better organized separately, etc. If you're interested in knowing exactly
what I know about technologies, you can follow my notes on Notion for Data
Science by clicking [here](https://raickmiranda.notion.site/33e89e94ea434bba9c0506ba90d8c201?v=bfdff60052c843c38a12e19b60f80960&pvs=4).
